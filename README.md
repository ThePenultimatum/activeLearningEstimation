# Filters and Estimation

## Overview
The code directory here contains files which perform filtering (particle filters and Kalma filters) on trajectory data and then output resultant performance metrics.

### Particle Filters

### Kalman Filters

## Results
Sample output for both filters can be found in the imgs directory.
